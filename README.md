Exploratory Data Analysis of an online retail business situated in the United Kingdom

The dataset titled "Online Retail II" encompasses all the transactions that took place between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011 for an online retail business situated in the United Kingdom. The business is registered and operates solely online, without any physical store locations. The primary focus of the company is the sale of distinctive gift-ware suitable for various occasions. A significant portion of the company's clientele consists of wholesale buyers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential and fundamental stage within the data analysis workflow. Data analysis can aid in the identification of evident errors, as well as enhance comprehension of patterns within the data, discover outliers or unusual events, and uncover intriguing relationships among variables. The utilisation of a thorough EDA report facilitates the comprehension of the Online Retail II dataset, enabling the identification of patterns and the acquisition of insights prior to engaging in more sophisticated analyses or modelling techniques.
